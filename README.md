# COSC415 Homework 1

Instructions:

Using the `index.html` file and `site.css` file, create a web page about either (a) yourself, or (b) something you are interested in.  

Basic parameters:

 * You can use bootstrap css if you'd like, but your `site.css` file must include some significant styling.  Don't just rely on bootstrap.
 * Your page must have at least one HTML table.
 * Your page must have at least one inline image, with an alternative rendering  (`alt` property).
 * Your page must have structural elements like a header, footer, and main area (and optionally, a sidebar).  The layout for those elements needs to be done through CSS.  You don't specifically need `<header>` etc. elements; it is ok to use `<div>` to more generically identify "sections" on your page, but your HTML structure must clearly reflect document structure.
 * Your page must include some kind of non-simplistic (non-default) layout.  For example, you could create a sidebar for navigation, or a fixed position menu along the top of the page.  You'll need to use `position` directive(s) in CSS in some way to fulfill this requirement.
 * You must use at least two non-default fonts.  You can use webfonts if you want, e.g., https://fonts.google.com or https://fontawesome.com.
 * You must adhere to the principle of "separation of concerns": your HTML should not embed any CSS (apart from a `link` element that references the associated CSS file(s)).
 * You must use at least one CSS class selector, at least one id selector, and at least one "descendent relationship" selector to connect your HTML with appropriate styling.

Overall, your goal is to make a page that you'd be proud to show others, with some modest complexity in its layout and styling.


## Homework feedback

 I spent around 4-5 days on this homework.

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
 I really enjoyed this homework! It's a very practical exercise that I am planning to use as a personal website in the future.

### Rubric/checklist

 - Required HTML structural elements are present
